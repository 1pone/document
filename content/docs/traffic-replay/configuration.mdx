**Max QPS**: In order to reduce the load on the user's machine under test, the maximum number of playback QPS can be modified as needed.

**Skip Mock**: If there are some third-party dependency paths that should not be mocked, you can click "**+ Add**" to add paths to ignore. During replay, AREX will not mock these dependencies, meaning that actual calls will be made.

<Callout title="Tip">
The exclusion template currently supports the following types of exclusion comparisons:

| Types     | path                  | value                                                      |
